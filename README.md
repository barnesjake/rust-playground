To compile: `rustc main.rs`

Build using cargo:

in the directory, run `cargo build`

this creates the runnable file, which can be run using `./target/debug/(filecreated)`

`cargo run` can be used to build and run the program in one command

to check the code compiles, run `cargo check`

`cargo build --release` creates a file in /releases and includes optimizations to make the rust code run faster
